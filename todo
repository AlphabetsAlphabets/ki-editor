- [x] scrolling view
- [x] swapping?
- [x] transactional edit: so that exchanging siblings can be undone in one step
  instead of two smaller steps
- [x] multi-cursor
- [] split window (needed for autocomplete, prompt)
     - parent-child architecture
     - each window can have multiple children window
     - when a window is closed, all of its children are closed
     - each window have a group, if any of the window in the same group is closed
       all windows in the same group should be closed
- [] LSP (after window system implemented)
- [x] swap d to ^x, y to ^c
- [x] ^f for find
- [x] f/F for moving forward/backward (so that it's consistent with other
     actions, which is selection mode first, then action)
- [] g for selecting the next node that is the same generation (descendant
  level from root) as the current node
- [] e for elevate the current node such that it becomes the siblings of its parent
- [] e for enclose the current node with one of the brackets
- [] ([{ for enclosing current selection with brackets
- [] f for moving to the next node which has the same field name as the current node
- [x] moving selection should scroll the page when out of view
- [] mechanism for adding selection to all matching selection within current selection
- [x] remove windows, as it is useless
- [] incorporate AST grep (https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep)
- [x] e for eating forward, useful for replacing current node with parent, also might make `d` obsolete
- [x] implement buffer
- [] multi eat parent should not proceed if the final edit overlaps
- [] use patch for undo (undo history should be stored under buffer)
