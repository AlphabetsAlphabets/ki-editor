# Native/Global

Selection modes that are categorized here are those that are applicable both natively (current file) and globally (across the workspace).

There are 3 categories of Native/Global selection modes:

1. [Text Search](./text-search.md)
1. [LSP-based](./lsp-based.md)
1. [Misc](./misc.md)

These selection modes are nested under `n` (Native) or `g` (Global).
